### Full stack application assigned as the final project from Per Scholas' Software Engineer Course

## Project Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to create a full stack application that implements what we have learned using React.js, JWt, and working with an API that we have created using RESTful routing and CRUD actions. This application was deployed on Heroku and can be navigated to [here](https://jmfitness.herokuapp.com/login), the back-end portion of the application can be navigated to [here](https://github.com/Sapphire-Coder/fitness-api).

## Technologies:

## Description
This application is used to keep track of personal workouts that the user enjoys. This is done by creating an account, and logging in. Both authentication and authorization are completed using JWT and passwords hashed using bcrypt. The user can navigate to their stored workouts, or go to the boardsite portion where they and other users can share workouts with a brief description, and the workouts can be added to the user's personal workouts from there. Comments can also be created to share individual viewpoints of the information.[^1]
